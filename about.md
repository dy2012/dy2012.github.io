### This site

Born out of necessity (to get github project pages working), I figured
blogging may even prove a useful means of noting things that would otherwise
get buried in mailing lists.

### About me 

My background is in [Control Science & Engineering](http://baike.baidu.com/view/3316802.htm?fr=aladdin).
